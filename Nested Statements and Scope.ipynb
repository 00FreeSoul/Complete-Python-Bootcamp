    "#Nested Statements and Scope \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have gone over on writing our own functions, its important to understand how Python deals with the variable names you assign. When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a *namespace*. Variable names also have a *scope*, the scope determines the visbility of that variable name to other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of scope in your code is very important to understand in order to properly assign and call variable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the idea of scope can be described by 3 general rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name assignments will create or change local names by default.\n",
    "2. Name references search (at most) four scopes:\n",
    "    * local\n",
    "    * any enclosing functions\n",
    "    * global\n",
    "    * built-in\n",
    "3. Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module        and function scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEGB Rule.**\n",
    "\n",
    "L: Local — Names assigned in any way within a function (def or lambda)), and not declared global in that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "E: Enclosing function locals — Name in the local scope of any and all enclosing functions (def or lambda), from inner to outer.\n",
    "\n",
    "G: Global (module) — Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or declared global in a def within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Built-in (Python) — Names preassigned in the built-in names module : open,range,SyntaxError,..."
